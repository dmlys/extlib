	// Ideally i want to specify abstract virtual interfaces for future, promise, packaged_task,
	// and ext::future, ext::promise, ext::packaged_task would be front-end classes used by clients.
	// This library would provide implementation of those interfaces via:
	// * shared_state_basic - type-independent implementation: refcount, wait, etc
	// * shared_state - type-dependent implementation: get, set_value, etc
	// but clients would be able to implement own if they need so.
	//
	// It's very hard to specify future interface(ifuture) for 2 reasons:
	// * this one minor:
	//
	//   If ifuture is template of Type, then shared_state_basic implements ifuture<Type>(or other template interface).
	//   This would lead to duplication of type-independent methods for each specialization in objects files - code bloat.
	//   Another option - use multiple inheritance(possibly with virtual base classes) - this leads to slightly increased object size, which is unwanted.
	//
	//   ifuture could be not a template class -> and get method would return void *.
	//   Parametrization would be done by front-end classes: future, shared_future.
	//   While ifuture is loosely typed, ext::future, ext::shared_future takes care of this.
	//
	// * major:
	//
	//   it's hard to specify/define 'then' method:
	//   it's takes some functor template as argument, and returns future of RetType,
	//   where RetType is return type of argument-functor.
	//
	//   What signature should method 'then' have? (it is in a interface and should be virtual)
	//   It could return typeless ifuture, and ext::future, ext::shared_future takes care of typization.
	//   But how functor should be passed? std::function<RetType()>? What RetType should be?
	//
	//      std::function<void *()> could be used -> now method 'then' could create packaged_task<void *()> and return it.
	//      But it's state is of type void *, not Type. Where Type instance will be stored?
	//      Implementation of then method cannot know origin type, so it cannot allocate some additional storage for it.
	//
	//      Special type erased object with virtual methods can be created, holding internally both space for return value and functor itself.
	//      That object can be created on stack and pointer and it's size can be passed into then method,
	//      implementation would create object based on that additional space and copy into it - this would avoid extra heap allocation.
	//      Also there are would be some align caveats, but they are solvable.
	//      That would work - but it's somewhat complicated, also incur some additional virtual calls.
	//
	// For now implement without interfaces. ext::future would hold a pointer to shared_state<Type>.
	// Method 'then' will be template function -> thus can easily create packaged_task<RetType()>

	// Shared state implementation is divided between several classes:
	// * shared_state_basic - type independent part, implementation of promise state, continuations
	// * shared_state - type dependent part, have space for object, exception pointer
	// * shared_state_unexceptional - same as shared_state, but does not allow set_exception and thus not storing std::exception_ptr,
	//                                can be used by asynchronous task not throwing exceptions
	// Some other classes are:
	// * continuation_task        - shared_state derived class used for continuations
	// * continuation_waiter      - shared_state derived abstract class used as continuations which for wait functionality
	// * continuation_waiter_impl - implementation of continuation_waiter using std::mutex and std::condition_variable
	// * packaged_task_base       - packaged_task implementation interface
	// * packaged_task_impl       - packaged_task implementation
	//
	// * when_(any/all)_task               - classes for implementing when_all/any functions
	// * when_(any/all)_task_continuation  - classes for implementing when_all/any functions

	/// shared_state_basic type independent part, implementation of future/promise state, basic continuations support
	/// 
	/// Design goals:
	/// * we must hold information of promise state to prevent multiple value submission.
	/// * future status - ready, cancelled, broken promise(promise destroyed without setting value).
	/// * continuations - those can be submitted concurrently via multiple shared_futures to the same shared state.
	/// * waiting - future can be waited for becoming ready, including concurrently via shared_futures
	/// 
	///
	/// Waiting means mutex and condition_variable.
	/// On the other hand - I want this object to be as small as possible, with reasonable complexity.
	/// I don't want it to always hold mutex and condition variable, which are not trivial classes.
	/// 
	/// Also while future goal is to be used in multi-thread environment -
	/// 'wait' and 'then' calls would not have big concurrency in normal program.
	/// Normally user adds few continuations and that's all, wait calls also usually not so frequent(not like call wait_for(10ms) in a loop).
	///
	/// To handle continuations we have sort of intrusive single linked list of continuations.
	/// We control implementation of 'then' method and how continuation are created.
	/// Each continuation is heap-allocated object derived from us(shared_state_basic)
	/// and holds atomic pointer to next continuation.
	/// 
	/// Waiting is also implemented as continuation object, this allows avoiding holding of mutex and condition_variable
	/// in shared_state_basic itself, and instead hold them in continuation object.
	/// continuation_waiter is acquired from waiter pool, when wait request is issued.
	/// It is shared between multiple wait calls, and released when there are none.
	/// There is always no more than 1 continuation_waiter for given future(shared_state_basic) object,
	/// and if it's present - it's always at the head of continuation chain.
	/// This allows easy sharing on continuation_waiter and removing it, when not needed.
	/// 
	///
	/// While atomic pointers are used, single linked list is NOT lock-free.
	/// Lock-free implementation would be very hard, if possible.
	/// 
	/// Instead we use pointer locking:
	/// locking pointer - is a spin-lock loop trying to set low bit to 1, while expecting it to be 0.
	/// Assuming not high concurrency(see above) it should posses no problems.
	/// 
	/// Also when shared_state become ready, all new submitted continuations must be executed immediately.
	/// There is a race condition here. While we are adding new continuation - we could become ready.
	/// To prevent this, continuation submission and transition to fulfilled state must be done in single atomic step.
	/// This is done by locking head and replacing it with special ready value.
	/// 
	/// Simplified algorithms:
	/// Wherever there is a waiting request:
	/// 1. lock slist head.
	/// 2. if special ready value - waiting is not needed - return.
	/// 3. if head is a waiter continuation:
	///    * if so, it's refcount is increased and object returned to caller(caller waits on it).
	///    * if not - waiter object is acquired from pool and placed as new head,
	///      after that it's returned to caller.
	/// 4. unlock head
	/// 
	/// Whenever new continuation is added - new object is created,
	/// 1. lock slist head.
	/// 2. if special ready value - execute continuation immediately and return.
	/// 3. checked if it is continuation_waiter:
	///    * if so - continuation inserted after head,
	///    * if not - continuation added as new head.
	/// 4. unlock head
	/// 
	/// we hold state as atomic std::uintptr_t:
	/// * 0x0      - future_status::ready, unlocked
	/// * 0x1      - future_status::ready, locked
	/// * 0xFF..FF - waiting result and no continuations, locked
	///   0xFF..FE - waiting result and no continuations, unlocked, also initial value
	/// * other    - waiting result and this is head of slist(pointer to next continuation)
	/// 
	/// When shared_state becomes ready, state changes to future_status::ready
	/// and previous val is head of continuation slist which must be executed.
	///
	/// NOTE: promise state is only checked by set_value path -> we can use sort of hierarchical lock,
	///       first change promise state -> than change future state.

		// Increasing the reference counter can always be done with memory_order_relaxed:
		//   New references to an object can only be formed from an existing reference,
		//   and passing an existing reference from one thread to another must already provide any required synchronization.
		//
		// It is important to enforce any possible access to the object in one thread
		// (through an existing reference) to happen before deleting the object in a different thread.
		//
		// This is achieved by a "release" operation after dropping a reference
		// (any access to the object through this reference must obviously happened before),
		// and an "acquire" operation before deleting the object.
		//
		// It would be possible to use memory_order_acq_rel for the fetch_sub operation,
		// but this results in unneeded "acquire" operations
		// when the reference counter does not yet reach zero and may impose a performance penalty.
